Winding is a process of transferring yarn from one package to another or from a number of small packages (spinnerâ€™s packages, spools or hanks) to a big package 
i.e. a cone or cheese
that is more suitable for the next processes such as warping or knitting or for any other suitable use such as on shuttle-less looms.
