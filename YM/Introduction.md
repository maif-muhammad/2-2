<details> <summary>What is the effect of combing</summary> <p>Carded fibers include short fibers whereas combed fibers have low short fiber %. Combing reduces the small fiber by 12-16%. As small fibers can't fully participate in twisting, it results in protruding fibers, neps.
Fiber length less than half of a inch is called small fiber
