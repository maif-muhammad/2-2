[[Spun Yarn]]
-   **The following three characteristics are evident for staple spun yarn:**
1. A linear assembly of fibers. The assembly could be of any thickness
2. The fibers are held together by twist. However, other means may be used to achieve cohesion
3. There is a tendency for fibers to lie in parallel along the twist spiral.
