>Two Groups depending on the origin of the fiber-forming materials from which they are produced 
1. Natural Polymer Fibers - fiber-forming material is of natural origin
2. Synthetic Fibers - fiber forming material is made from simpler substances 
---
-  Synthetic Fiber: Obtained by **chemical synthesis**
- Regenerated Fiber: Obtained by **conversion of natural fiber** by chemical process is called regenerated fiber
