Objective: 
Making Pre Beam/ Warper's Beam/ Back Beam for final beam/weaver's beam/ warp beam

High speed warping machine is divided into two sections:
1. Headstock
2. Creel 

---
#### In Lab

Creel capacity = 600 
Delivery Capacity = 300 (15 guide per bar = 10 bar = 150 * 2 = 300)
Magazine type creel - head is tied up with tail
Creel Shape - V type 

Function of dropper - Auto stopper. If any yarn braks, it drops signalling the machine to stop ; also indicates the row 

Headstock
Glass rod - uniform flow of yarn 
Zigzag - expanding reed/ adjustable reed/ open reed ; we can expand or shrink it as desired > we control epi(width)

Lab Lecture 
warping machine - 2 parts  
Creel frame and headstock  
  
1. Truck creel  
2. magazine creel  
3. Swivel creel  
  
Package two parts - head and tail  
Lab creel - magazine  
Head tail knot _ 2 package 1 package  
Lab - V shape creel  
  
Creel holder - package  
Input cheese cone  
  
Guide (ceramic)  
  
Disc type tensioner - provides tension  
  
Deadweight - tension  
  
  
Dropper - senses flaws  
Yarn slack - dropper drops - sensor guide - machine autostop  
  
  
Ceramic guide - 15 guide per bar - 10 bar = x * 2 = 300 (creel capacity)  
  
Rave - adjustable (extend or shrink) beam width wise wind yarn  
Yarn density  
Yarn distance  
  
  
Flange to flange distance = fabric width  
Barrel - yarn positoned  
Beam bracket - beam positioned  
Width increse extend  
Friction drum - rotates (indirect)  
Rack and pinion - beam dia increase - beam away from drun surface  
Measuring roller - measuring yarn  
Drum pi d = input revolution  
Warping direct, drive system indirect  
Motor - power generator  
Uv light - oba treat while in package, light helps if the treatment is done.  
  
  
Creeling - খালি প্যাকেজ তুলে নতুন প্যাকেজ বসানো  
Piecing - yarn knotting process - head & tail connection  
Dofing - পুরান বিম সরিয়ে নতুন বিম
